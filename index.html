    Waiting for me by the gate was Sofi, her wispy hair stuck to her chubby cheeks, her bottom lip jutting out.<br>
    “You didn’t come when I called you! You didn’t come and I didn’t know where you were.”<br>
    “I am here now, silly,” I said, offering her my hand.<br>
    She yawned and slid her hand in mine. It was warm and sticky. “You didn’t come,” she repeated.<br>
    “Veronika, your boots,” Uncle reminded me as I helped him and Sofi up the steps.<br>
    “Yes, Uncle, thank you.”<br>
    “Always look after your boots. Look after your boots and they will look after you…”<br>
    Before I could reply, a banging on the front door startled all three of us. They were here!<br>
    Megan, my captain, beamed at me, her face shiny and excited. “Last port of call for Sherburn Sands! All aboard! Who’s coming?”<br>
    Behind her, I could see our minibus parked in the middle of the street. Several faces peered through the windows and my team-mates waved at me.<br>
    “Please wait,” I said, panicking. “I just have to…” I turned, almost bumping into Yuri.<br>
    He dumped my bag at my feet. “Your belongings, ma’am.”<br>
    I frowned at him. What was this? My brother being helpful!<br>
    “Is everything in there? My toothbrush? My kit?” I asked anxiously.<br>
    He bowed. “Your toothbrush. Your kit. Your Highness.”<br>
    “You’re sure?” I said. If he was playing one of his tricks…<br>
    “I’m sure.” He gave me a sheepish grin.<br>
    “I believe you,” I said, giving him a swift kiss on the cheek. I dashed into the front room and kissed Uncle and Sofi, too, then darted back into the hallway. “Be good,” I instructed Yuri, hoisting my bag onto my shoulders and following Megan into the street. My heart began beating fast. It was actually happening. World Cup tournament, here I come!<br>
    I turned and waved at the three figures at the window – and for a moment I didn’t want to go. But only for a moment.

    <strong>Full Interview – My Circus Life (word-for-word)</strong><br><br>
    Some people might be good at their jobs, but performer Vladik Miagkostoupov was actually born to do his! Raised by two Moscow Circus performers, young Vladik was tutored early on by his juggler father. By age nine, he’d perfected enough of his natural acrobatic and juggling skills to work full time with the circus.<br><br>
    Combining a seamless mix of acrobatics, dance and juggling, the star has performed with a range of companies in Paris and Monte Carlo. Several years ago, Vladik – who is now 28, married and a dad – began as a character in Dralion, an epic performance piece.<br><br>

    <strong>Full Extract – A Traveller in Time (word-for-word)</strong><br><br>
    Ours was a steep, crooked stair, with a handrail on one side, very narrow, with rooms leading off it so suddenly that it was easy to fall headlong as one stepped from a doorway. We had wallpaper with leaves on it, like a green wood in spring, and I used to sit on the stairs, pretending I was in a forest with birds singing around me. I was sitting there one evening, with my feet tucked under me, in a blue dusk, waiting for the lamplighter to come whistling down the street to bring a gleam to the stairway. There was a street lamp near, and this shone over the door and saved us from using our own gas-lamp.<br><br>
    I was suddenly aware how quiet it was. I might have been the only person in the world. Even the clock stopped ticking, and the mice ceased rustling in the wainscot. I turned my head and saw a lady coming downstairs from the upper floor. She was dressed in a black dress which swept round her like a cloud, and at her neck was a narrow white frill which shone like ivory. Her eyes were very bright and blue as violets. I sprang to my feet and smiled up at her, into the beautiful grave face she bent towards me. She gave an answering smile, and her deep-set eyes seemed to pierce me, and I caught my breath as I stood aside to let her pass. I never heard a footstep; she was there before I was aware.<br><br>
